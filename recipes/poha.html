        <h1>Poha Recipe</h1>
        <p>Ingredients:
            2 cups thick Poha (rice flakes)
            1 medium Onion, finely chopped (approx. 1/3 cup)
            1 small Potato, peeled and finely chopped (approx. ½ cup)
            1/3 teaspoon Mustard Seeds
            1/2 teaspoon Cumin Seeds
            8-10 Curry Leaves
            1 Green Chili, finely chopped
            1 pinch of Asafoetida (Hing), optional
            1½ tablespoon Peanuts (ground nuts)
            1/4 teaspoon Turmeric Powder
            1½ teaspoons Lemon Juice
            1/2 tablespoon Sugar
            1 tablespoon grated Coconut, optional
            Salt to taste
            2 tablespoons Oil
            1/4 cup Pomegranate Seeds, optional
            2 tablespoons finely chopped Coriander Leaves</p>
            <p>step-1
                Take poha in a large strainer.
                step-2
                Wash it 1-2 times by gently swifting them with your fingers under running water. Drain the excess water through a strainer. Sprinkle salt and sugar over it, mix/toss well and keep aside.
                step-3
                Heat 2-tablespoons oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds; when they start to splutter, add cumin seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, peanuts and a pinch of asafoetida. Allow them to sizzle until chilies turn crisp for approx. 30-40 seconds.
                step-4
                Add chopped onions and sauté until onions turn translucent.
                
                step-5
                Add chopped potatoes and salt (add salt only for potatoes).
                step-6
                Mix well and cook covered until potatoes turn tender. This will take around 3-4 minutes. Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.
                step-7
                Add turmeric powder.
                step-8
                Mix well and cook for a minute.
                step-9
                Add soaked poha.
                step-10
                Mix well.
                step-11
                Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add lemon juice, dry grated coconut and finely chopped coriander leaves.
                step-12
                Mix well and turn off the flame. Batata poha is ready for serving.

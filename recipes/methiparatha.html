            <li>1/4 cup Besan (gram flour), optional</li>
            <li>1 cup Fenugreek Leaves (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Cumin Seeds</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons Green Chilli-Ginger Paste (1 green chilli + ½ inch ginger), optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Curd (Plain Yogurt)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Oil + for shallow frying</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pluck methi leaves (fenugreek leaves) from stems.</li>
            <li>Add plucked leaves in a bowl filled with water and keep them soaked for approx. 2-3 minutes to dissolve and separate any dirt/debri. Remove the leaves from the water and repeat the process 2-3 times or more (as needed) to clean methi leaves. Finely chop cleaned green methi leaves.</li>
            <li>Sift 1-cup whole wheat flour and gram flour in a wide mouth large bowl. Add cumin seeds, green chili-ginger paste, red chilli powder, curd, 1-tablespoon oil, finely chopped methi leaves and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add water as needed to knead a smooth and soft dough like chapati. Cover the dough with a cloth or a plate and keep it aside for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough again. Divide it into 7-8 equal portions. Take each portion one by one, give it a round shape like ball and press it between your palms to give a pattie like shape.</li>
            <li>Take 1/2 cup dry wheat flour in a small plate. Take one pattie and coat it with dry wheat flour and place it over a rolling board.</li>
            <li>Roll it out into a circle having 4-5 inch diameter. Spread few drops of oil over one half portion using a spoon or brush.</li>
            <li>Fold it into a half circle. Again, spread few drops of oil over it and fold into a triangle.</li>
            <li>Coat the triangle shaped pattie with dry wheat flour and roll it out into a thin triangle having approx. 6-7 inch long sides.</li>
            <li>Heat the tava over medium flame. When it is medium hot, place rolled paratha over it.</li>
            <li>When tiny bubbles start to appear on the surface, flip the paratha. It will take around 30-40 seconds. Spread approx. ½ teaspoon oil evenly over its surface using a spatula.</li>
            <li>After 30-40 seconds, flip the paratha and spread ½ teaspoon oil evenly on the surface using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Press it gently with spatula and flip and cook until golden brown spots appear on both sides.</li>
            <li>Transfer it to a plate. Repeat steps 7 to 14 for remaining dough patties. Methi Ke Parathe is ready for serving. Serve it hot with plain curd or boondi raita and pickle.</li>
